This site will contain code modified from various projects created during the Computer Science 
bachelor's program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).

The modifications made are intended to extend the functionality of the original project work,
in an effort to fulfill the requirements of the Computer Science Capstone course (CS-499).

Updates will come as the course progresses.
