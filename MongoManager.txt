# MongoManager
# ---
#  
# This class provides a full-featured Mongo database management library.  
# This functionality offered by this class provides methods for:
#
#    > Authentication and connection to any Mongo instance
#    > Database creation, deletion, listing, switching
#    > Collection creation, deletion, listing, renaming
#    > CRUD operations for any collection (which was the inital purpose of the class from which this derived)
#    > Index creation, listing, deletion
#    > Aggregation pipelines
#    > Schema validation helpers
#    > Backup/restore helpers (simple JSON-based)
#    > Flexible function signatures with optional parameters
#        
# In order to function properly, access for and connection to an existing mongo installation is required.  A routine
# to manage authentication and connection is available within the library.
# ---
# Version History:
# +++
#     v0.1 - May 24, 2026 - Incorporated and updated AAC_CRUD_Operations.py written for CS340 adding more comprehensive set
#                               of methods that are geared towards full database utility rather than only CRUD operations.
# +++
#     v1.0 - June 20, 2026 - Nearing final updates prior to finishing out the Capstone project for SNHU course CS-499.
#                               Added enhancements to facilitate presenting the class as API routines on a Swagger endpoint, then
#                               continued to add updates as new work was incorporated that presents a SQL to Mongo translation
#                               feature.  Existing operations were maintained, with the base CRUD routines and the added 
#                               management features providing a stable back-end for the Swagger API interface.
